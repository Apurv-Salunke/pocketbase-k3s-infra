   - Node status
   - Basic pod deployment
   ```

### Phase 2: Core Application Components
1. **Base Deployments**
   - Create Go Server deployment manifests
   - Create Helper Server deployment manifests
   - Setup service definitions
   ```bash
   # Testing requirements:
   - Application deployments
   - Service connectivity
   - Basic functionality
   ```

2. **Storage and Networking**
   - Implement persistent volume configurations
   - Setup ingress controllers
   - Configure TLS
   ```bash
   # Testing requirements:
   - Data persistence
   - Ingress routing
   - HTTPS connectivity
   ```

### Phase 3: Configuration Management
1. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**
   - Create configuration templates
   - Setup secret management
   - Implement credential rotation
   ```bash
   # Testing requirements:
   - Config loading
   - Secret access
   - Rotation mechanisms
   ```

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Deploy Prometheus configurations
   - Setup Grafana dashboards
   - Configure alerting rules
   ```bash
   # Testing requirements:
   - Metrics collection
   - Dashboard visibility
   - Alert triggering
   ```

### Phase 4: CI/CD Components
1. **ECR Integration**
   - Setup ECR repositories
   - Create image build scripts
   - Configure pull secrets
   ```bash
   # Testing requirements:
   - Image pushing
   - Image pulling
   - Authentication
   ```

2. **Deployment Automation**
   - Create GitHub Actions workflows
   - Setup deployment scripts
   - Implement rollback mechanisms
   ```bash
   # Testing requirements:
   - Automated deployments
   - Rollback functionality
   - Pipeline triggers
   ```

### Phase 5: Update and Maintenance
1. **Update Scripts**
   - Create version update scripts
   - Setup maintenance jobs
   - Implement health checks
   ```bash
   # Testing requirements:
   - Update procedures
   - Health monitoring
   - Automated maintenance
   ```

2. **Backup Solutions**
   - Setup Velero configurations
   - Create backup scripts
   - Implement recovery procedures
   ```bash
   # Testing requirements:
   - Backup creation
   - Restore functionality
   - Data integrity
   ```

## Testing Workflow

For each phase, we follow this testing workflow:

1. **Initial Implementation**
   - Provide initial code files
   - Include detailed testing instructions
   - List expected outcomes

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Test provided scripts
   - Verify functionality
   - Report any issues

3. **Refinement**
   - Address reported issues
   - Implement improvements
   - Document changes

4. **Final Validation**
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Performance verification
   - Security checks

## Implementation Order

1. Infrastructure Scripts (Foundation)
2. Core Application Components (Basic Functionality)
3. Configuration Management (Proper Setup)
4. CI/CD Components (Automation)
5. Update and Maintenance Scripts (Operations)
