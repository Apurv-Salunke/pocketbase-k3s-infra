## Detailed K3s Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

1. **EC2 Instance Provisioning**
   - Select an appropriate EC2 instance size based on your workload
   - Configure security groups to allow necessary traffic (HTTP/HTTPS, SSH)
   - Set up an Elastic IP for a stable public IP address

2. **K3s Installation**
   - Install k3s on the EC2 instance
   - Configure k3s to use containerd as the container runtime
   - Set up proper authentication and access controls

3. **Storage Configuration**
   - Set up persistent storage for your application data
   - Configure volume mounts for the go-server's pb_data

4. **Networking Setup**
   - Configure DNS for your domain to point to your EC2 instance
   - Set up TLS certificates for HTTPS (using Let's Encrypt)

### Phase 2: Kubernetes Resource Definition

1. **Namespace Creation**
   - Create dedicated namespaces for your applications

2. **Deployment Manifests**
   - Create Kubernetes Deployments for:
     - go-server
     - helper-server
   - Configure resource limits and requests
   - Set up health checks and readiness probes

3. **Service Definitions**
   - Create Kubernetes Services for internal communication
   - Configure appropriate selectors and ports

4. **Ingress Configuration**
   - Set up Traefik as the Ingress Controller
   - Define Ingress resources for routing traffic to your services
   - Configure TLS termination

5. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**
   - Store configuration in ConfigMaps
   - Store sensitive information in Secrets

### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration

1. **ECR Integration**
   - Configure k3s to pull images from your ECR repository
   - Set up authentication for ECR access

2. **Deployment Automation**
   - Extend your CI pipeline to deploy to k3s after pushing to ECR
   - Implement rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
   - Set up alerting for critical issues

2. **Backup Strategy**
   - Implement regular backups of persistent data
   - Test restore procedures

3. **Update Strategy**
   - Plan for k3s updates
   - Plan for application updates

Let's start implementing this plan. Would you like me to begin by creating the Kubernetes manifests for your services?
